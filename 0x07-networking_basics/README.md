# Networking Basics Project

This project focuses on fundamental concepts in networking and DevOps, covering topics such as the OSI model, types of networks, MAC and IP addresses, TCP/UDP, and more.

## 0. OSI Model

### Overview

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is an abstract framework that describes layered communication and computer network design. It is organized from the lowest level (layer 1) for physical transmission to the highest level (layer 7) for application-specific communication.

### Learning Objectives

- Understand the OSI model
- Know the organization of the OSI model

### Script

- **File:** [0-OSI_model](0x07-networking_basics/0-OSI_model)
- **Description:** Bash script providing information about the OSI model and its organization.

## 1. Types of Network

### Overview

Different types of networks include LAN (Local Area Network) that connects local devices, WAN (Wide Area Network) that connects LANs, and the Internet operating over WANs.

### Learning Objectives

- Identify the type of network a computer is connected to
- Understand networks connecting offices in different locations

### Script

- **File:** [1-types_of_network](0x07-networking_basics/1-types_of_network)
- **Description:** Bash script addressing questions about types of networks.

## 2. MAC and IP Address

### Overview

Understanding MAC addresses (Media Access Control) and IP addresses, where MAC is the unique identifier of a network interface, and IP is akin to a postal address for devices on a network.

### Learning Objectives

- Define MAC and IP addresses
- Understand their roles in networking

### Script

- **File:** [2-MAC_and_IP_address](0x07-networking_basics/2-MAC_and_IP_address)
- **Description:** Bash script answering questions related to MAC and IP addresses.

## 3. UDP and TCP

### Overview

Differentiate between UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) in terms of data transfer speed and reliability.

### Learning Objectives

- Understand the characteristics of UDP and TCP

### Script

- **File:** [3-UDP_and_TCP](0x07-networking_basics/3-UDP_and_TCP)
- **Description:** Bash script addressing questions about UDP and TCP.

## 4. TCP and UDP Ports

### Overview

Explore the concept of ports in networking, focusing on the commonly used ports such as SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS.

### Learning Objectives

- Recognize the importance of ports in networking
- List commonly used ports

### Script

- **File:** [4-TCP_and_UDP_ports](0x07-networking_basics/4-TCP_and_UDP_ports)
- **Description:** Bash script displaying listening ports with PID and program names.

## 5. Is the Host on the Network

### Overview

Introduce the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) and create a Bash script to ping an IP address to check for network connectivity.

### Learning Objectives

- Understand the use of ICMP in network troubleshooting
- Create a script to ping an IP address

### Script

- **File:** [5-is_the_host_on_the_network](0x07-networking_basics/5-is_the_host_on_the_network)
- **Description:** Bash script for pinging an IP address.

**Note:** Ensure all Bash scripts are executable, follow the guidelines, and pass shellcheck without errors.
